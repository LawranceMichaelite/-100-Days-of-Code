        <h1 style="text-align: center;">JOURNEY INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
        <p style="color:darkgreen ; text-align: left; font-family: 'Consolas'; font-size: large;">
            <strong>Hello there,</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
                         My name is <strong>Lawrance</strong> , Studying in <strong>Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Technology</strong>
            Its been one year after choosing my journey into Computer Science. The word <em>programming</em> is the Most heared word in my way to Computer Science.
            Due to over-hype of the word programming, I really wanted to try that. So I chose my First Programming Language after lots and lots of Research.
            And that is <strong>HTML</HTML></strong>. ROFL! I was just kidding. It is <u>Python</u> . When I saw my first Program, the So Called <strong>"Hello, World"</strong>
            I wanted to run that Program again and again. I was wondering how this is Actually working. After some Research I get to know that there is Something called a <strong>Interpretor</strong>
            which is responsible for the Execution of My program and Because of that it is called as <strong>Interpreted Language</strong> . I thought, If I see something new, then there must be something Opposite to that and
            it is called as <strong>Compiled Language</strong>. 
        </p>
        <h1>So What's Next ?</h1>
        <p>
            After knowing about Compiled Language. I started to Explore about it. The first Compiled Language I learn't is C and C++.
            To say the truth it is absolutely Awesome.
        </p>
