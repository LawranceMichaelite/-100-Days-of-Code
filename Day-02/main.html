            The keys to being a good developer are well known.
            Greatness, however, requires something else altogether.
            And Steve Jobs nailed this fact to perfection when he said,<br>
            “The difference between the best worker on computer hardware and the average may be 2 to 1, if
            you’re lucky.
            With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software, it’s at least 25 to 1.
            The difference between the average programmer and a great one is at least that.”
            <br>
            If writing code were a science, all developers would pretty much be the same.
            Just as in art, no two developers have the same thinking or perception or the subjective truth while writing
            code for the same outcome.
            While some struggle to produce the desired outcome, to a few, it comes almost naturally, as if an epiphany
            hits them at the moment they sit to create programs or solve a problem.
            So that brings us to the quintessential question.<br>
            Yes. GREAT developers are self-driven people and have an extraordinary will to push through any odds. The
            willingness to stay motivated with a problem until it’s resolved (not to be confused with sitting on a
            problem), coupled with the ability to creatively solve it, is a highly desired skill or aptitude found only
            in great developers.The biggest goal of such self-motivated developers is to get into a mindset where they
            produce high-quality software all the time, regardless of the obstacles, problems, and self-doubt they
            encounter.
            And this mindset can be developed by following the teachings of a person who lived 2000 years ago.
            He was a philosopher, a king and had developed the reputation of being an ideal, wise leader. Plato called
            him the “philosopher king” in respect.
            Marcus has remained relevant for 2,000 years largely due to his writings collected as “ Meditations,” which
            President Bill Clinton has said is one of his favorite books. “Meditations” is closer to a diary than a
            philosophical treatise.
            As it turned out, Marcus Aurelius no matter where he was, even on the battlefield, he self-reflected and
            wrote his thoughts in this diary. <br></p>

    <div class="sub_topic">
        <p>
            This document is the
            definitive text on humility,
            self-discipline, personal ethics, strength, and is considered one of the best philosophy works of all
            time. And this book is also one of the best motivational guides available to software developers to be
            GREAT in their jobs. And some of the mind-blowing lessons we can learn from Marcus Aurelius can be as
            below.<br>
            A developer earns his bread by solving problems. We all love to be able to do something creative for the
            world, for our customer. We love the accolades and the appreciations that come along with it.
            But life is not always a bunch of roses.
            We do get demoralized when the tester reports a serious bug in our code. We get in the defensive mode
            when a
            customer is “not happy” with the functionality provided by us. Our “developer ego” comes to our rescue
            all
            guns blazing in our defense and we fail to see the other side of the coin, the problem itself.
            Any “bug” or “reported” issue is a great opportunity to self-reflect, see what have we done wrong and
            learn
            from our mistakes. We may notice that we didn’t write a test for an issue that we created, or that we
            didn’t
            refactor method that really needed that, or we haven’t followed some other best practices.
            Every time that life presents you with an obstacle, you must choose to perceive it as quality feedback…
            And
            use it to determine your next move.<br>
            So the best time to BEGIN something is NOW. Once we start working on our projects, we will find out that
            our
            tasks are not impossible. They can be hard or tedious, but they are not impossible.<br>
