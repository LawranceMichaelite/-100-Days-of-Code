                    <strong>Hello there,</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    Hope you are doing good.I just want to tell you Something about time.
                    Time is really very important in our life.If time goes it never comes again, if you waste your time
                    -
                    one day in
                    future you will realise that you did nothing in that particular time frame and then you will be feel
                    regretful.
                    So time is very precious thing, Use it wisely. Make perfect use of your beautiful time.Use time to
                    achieve your
                    dreams, do what you feel to do! Make use of each and every opportunity.Once buddha said <strong>"The
                        trouble is,
                        you think you have time"</strong>.But we suffer from Lack of time.Let me Elobrate that, <br>
                    An average person lives about 75-80 years. We spend about 25 years of our life sleeping(excluding
                    only
                    few).
                    That’s a big number which accounts for almost one third of our entire life, but still 30% of us
                    struggle
                    to
                    sleep well. We spend about 8 years of our life in social medias and internet, about 4 years eating
                    and
                    drinking,
                    about 4 years in education, about 2 years grooming(personal care), about 2 years shopping, about 1
                    year
                    in child
                    care, about 1&1/2 years travelling, about 6 years doing chores and about 10 years working. That
                    leaves
                    us with
                    only about 10 years. How are we going to spend it?.<br>
                    Everyday 86,400 seconds are deposited into our life account. At the end of the day once they’re all
                    used
                    up, we
                    get another new 86,400 seconds to start a new day.<br>

                    Likewise, imagine we wake up every day with $86,400 in our bank account, and at the end of the day
                    it’s
                    all gone
                    whether we spent it or not. And then the next day we get another $86,400. What would we do with it?
                    We
                    want to
                    make its best use , Is it? We don’t like to waste if it’s money, so why do we waste it when it comes
                    to
                    time?
                    Time is more precious than those dollars. Those seconds are so much powerful that you can make more
                    dollars but
                    you can’t make more time using dollars.<br>

                    To realize the value of 1 year, ask a student who failed his standard. To realize the value of 1
                    month,
                    ask a
                    mother who lost her child in the final month. To realize the value of 1 week, ask the editor of an
                    online
                    magazine. To realize the value of 1 hour, ask the couple who’s in a long distance relationship. To
                    realize the
                    value of 1 minute, ask the person who just missed a bus, train, or plane. To realize the value of 1
                    second, ask
                    the person who just missed an accident. To realize the value of a millisecond, ask the person who
                    just
                    came 2nd
                    at the Olympics.<br>

                    And Always Remember,<br>
